    <h1>Canada Overview</h1>
    <section class="font-size">
        <article class="absolute-size">
            <p class="font-s">
            Canada is a country in <span class="sp1">North America</span>. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific 
            and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering 9.98 million square kilometres (3.85 million square miles), making it the world's second-largest country by total area. Its southern and western border with the United States, stretching 8,891 kilometres (5,525 mi), is the world's longest bi-national land border. Canada's capital is Ottawa, and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver.
            Indigenous peoples have continuously inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years. Beginning in the 16th 
            century, British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast. 
            As a consequence of various armed conflicts, France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763. 
            In 1867, with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation, Canada was formed as a 
            federal dominion of four provinces. This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom. This widening autonomy was highlighted by the Statute of Westminster 1931 and culminated in the Canada Act 1982, which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the Parliament of the United Kingdom.
            Canada is a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy in the Westminster tradition. 
            The country's head of government is the prime minister—who holds office by virtue of their ability to command the 
            confidence of the elected House of Commons—and is appointed by the governor general, representing the monarch, 
            who serves as head of state. The country is a Commonwealth realm and is officially bilingual at the federal level. It ranks among the highest in international measurements of government transparency, civil liberties, quality of life, economic freedom, and education. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many other countries. Canada's long and complex relationship with the United States has had a significant impact on its economy and culture.
            A highly developed country, Canada has the 26th highest nominal per-capita income globally and the 
            sixteenth-highest ranking in the Human Development Index. Its advanced economy is the ninth-largest in the world, 
            relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks. 
            Canada is part of several major international and intergovernmental institutions or groupings including the United 
            Nations, NATO, the G7, the Group of Ten, the G20, <span id="sp2">the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)</span>, the World Trade Organization (WTO), the Commonwealth of Nations, the Arctic Council, the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, and the Organization of American States.

        <h2>Geography</h2>
            <p>
            By total area (including its waters), Canada is the second-largest country in the world, after Russia.<br/>
            <img src="img/canada-flag.png" alt="Canada geography" width="400" height="200"/>
            By land area alone, however, Canada ranks fourth, due to having the world's largest proportion of fresh water lakes.
            Stretching from the Atlantic Ocean in the east, along the Arctic Ocean to the north, and to the Pacific Ocean in the 
            west, the country encompasses 9,984,670 km2 (3,855,100 sq mi) of territory. Canada also has vast maritime terrain, with the world's longest coastline of 243,042 kilometres (151,019 mi). 128   129   In addition to sharing the world's largest land border with the United States—spanning 8,891 km (5,525 mi)—Canada shares a maritime boundary with Greenland to the northeast and with the France's overseas collectivity of Saint Pierre and Miquelon to the southeast. 130   Canada is also home to the world's northernmost settlement, Canadian Forces Station Alert, on the northern tip of Ellesmere Island—latitude 82.5°N—which lies 817 kilometres (508 mi) from the North Pole.
            The physical geography of Canada is widely varied. Boreal forests prevail throughout the country, ice is prominent in 
            northern Arctic regions and through the Rocky Mountains, and the relatively flat Canadian Prairies in the southwest 
            facilitate productive agriculture. The Great Lakes feed the St. Lawrence River (in the southeast) where the 
            lowlands host much of Canada's economic output. Canada has over 2,000,000 lakes—563 of which are greater than 
            100 km2 (39 sq mi)—containing much of the world's fresh water. There are also fresh-water glaciers in the 
            Canadian Rockies, the Coast Mountains and the Arctic Cordillera. Canada is geologically active, having many 
            earthquakes and potentially active volcanoes, notably Mount Meager massif, Mount Garibaldi, Mount Cayley massif, 
            and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex.

            <h3>Ethnisity</h3>
            <p class="decoration">According to the 2016 Canadian Census, the country's largest self-reported ethnic origin is Canadian
                (accounting for 32 percent of the population),[b] followed by English (18.3 percent), Scottish (13.9 percent),
                French (13.6 percent), Irish (13.4 percent), German (9.6 percent), Chinese (5.1 percent), Italian (4.6 percent), 
                First Nations (4.4 percent), Indian (4.0 percent), and Ukrainian (3.9 percent).There are 600 recognized
                First Nations governments or bands, encompassing a total of 1,525,565 people.
                The Indigenous population in Canada is growing at almost twice the national rate, and four percent of Canada's 
                population claimed an Indigenous identity in 2006. Another 22.3 percent of the population belonged to a 
                non-Indigenous visible minority.[358] In 2016, the largest visible minority groups were South Asian (5.6 percent), 
                Chinese (5.1 percent) and Black (3.5 percent).Between 2011 and 2016, the visible minority population rose by
                    18.4 percent.[358] In 1961, less than two percent of Canada's population (about 300,000 people) were members of 
                    visible minority groups.
                Indigenous peoples are not considered a visible minority in Statistics Canada calculations.[360]</p>

            <h3>Climate</h3>
            <p class="spacing">
                Average winter and summer high temperatures across Canada vary from region to region. Winters can be 
                harsh in many parts of the country, particularly in the interior and Prairie provinces, which experience a continental climate, 
                where daily average temperatures are near −15 °C (5 °F), but can drop below −40 °C (−40 °F) with severe wind chills.[137] In non-coastal regions, snow can cover the ground for almost six months of the year, while in parts of the north snow can persist year-round. Coastal British Columbia has a temperate climate, with a mild and rainy winter. On the east and west coasts, average high temperatures are generally in the low 20s °C (70s °F), while between the coasts, the average summer high temperature ranges from 25 to 30 °C (77 to 86 °F), with temperatures in some interior locations occasionally exceeding 40 °C (104 °F).[138]
                Much of Northern Canada is covered by ice and permafrost. The future of the permafrost is uncertain because the Arctic 
                has been warming at three times the global average as a result of climate change in Canada.[139] Canada's annual average 
                temperature over land has warmed by 1.7 °C (3.1 °F), with changes ranging from 1.1 to 2.3 °C (2.0 to 4.1 °F) in various regions, since 1948.[140] The rate of warming has been higher across the North and in the Prairies.[140] In the southern regions of Canada, air pollution from both Canada and the United States—caused by metal smelting, burning coal to power utilities, and vehicle emissions—has resulted in acid rain, which has severely impacted waterways, forest growth and agricultural productivity in Canada.[141]
